# 🍸 GSAP Cocktail Page

A slick, animated cocktail explorer built with **React** and **GSAP** animations. Because static websites are for boring drinks.

## What's This About?

This is a cocktail discovery page with smooth, butter-like animations powered by GSAP. Swirl through different cocktails, watch them come to life, and get inspired to make something tasty. The whole experience is designed to be fluid and fun.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - Component goodness
- **GSAP** - The animation engine that makes everything _smooth_
- **TypeScript** - Type safety because chaos is not a feature
- **TanStack Router** - Client-side routing with style
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast dev experience

## What I Learned (So Far)

### GSAP Mastery

- How to chain animations together like a choreographer
- Timeline manipulation and sequencing complex animation sequences
- Tweening properties smoothly without janky performance
- Working with different easing functions to get that _just right_ feel
- Animating DOM elements and managing their state during animations

### React + Animation Synergy

- Keeping animation logic separate from component logic (mostly)
- Using refs to grab DOM elements for GSAP to work its magic
- Handling animation cleanup to avoid memory leaks
- Triggering animations from React state/events without conflicts
- Performance considerations when animating multiple elements

### Web Dev General

- TanStack Router for more sophisticated routing patterns
- Building reusable animation components
- Creating a better dev experience with Vite
- CSS animations vs GSAP (and when GSAP wins every time)

## Current Status

🚧 **Work in Progress** - This is a learning project still cooking. Not all features are complete, but the foundation is solid and the animations are _chef's kiss_.

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser and prepare to be impressed (or at least mildly entertained).

## Future Plans

- [ ] More cocktail varieties
- [ ] Interactive mixer/builder
- [ ] Scroll-triggered animations
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness overhaul
- [ ] Real cocktail data integration

_Shaken, not stirred. Built with love and a lot of GSAP tweens._
